    "The reverse-search can be particularly useful.\n",

    "```ipython\n",
    "In [1]: def square(a):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Return the square of a\"\"\"\n",

    "Note that Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n or the up/down arrow keys can also be used to search through history, but only by matching characters at the beginning of the line.\n",
